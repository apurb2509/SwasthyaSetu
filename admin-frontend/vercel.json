  ### The Final Deployment Step
  
  After you have created and saved this new `vercel.json` file inside your `admin-frontend` directory, you must push this change to your GitHub repository.
  
  1.  From the **root `SwasthyaSetu` directory**, run:
      ```bash
      git add .
      git commit -m "fix(deploy): add vercel.json for admin-frontend routing"
      git push origin main

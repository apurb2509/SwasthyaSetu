SwasthyaSetu - AI Health Awareness Bot for Rural India
SwasthyaSetu is a multilingual, full-stack application designed to combat health misinformation and increase awareness of government healthcare schemes in rural India. It provides a reliable, AI-powered health assistant accessible via a modern web interface and basic SMS, ensuring digital inclusion for all.


üéØ The Problem
In many rural parts of India, access to reliable health information is limited. This leads to several critical issues:

Misinformation: Villagers often trust unverified messages on platforms like WhatsApp over professional medical advice.

Access Gaps: Limited proximity to clinics and doctors makes getting timely information difficult.

Low Scheme Awareness: Crucial government initiatives like Ayushman Bharat (PM-JAY) and vaccination drives are underutilized due to a lack of awareness and understanding.

Digital Divide: Many potential users do not have smartphones or consistent internet access, making web-only solutions ineffective.

‚úÖ The Solution: Key Features
SwasthyaSetu bridges this gap by providing a multi-platform solution with the following core features:

Multilingual AI Chatbot (SwasthyaDoot): A responsive web application where users can log in and have detailed conversations with an AI assistant about health topics, symptoms, and government schemes.

SMS-Based Chat: Users with basic mobile phones can interact with the same AI assistant by sending and receiving SMS messages, ensuring a fully inclusive platform.

Hinglish to Hindi Transliteration: The backend automatically detects Hinglish (e.g., "cancer ke lakshan") in SMS messages and converts it to Devanagari script for the AI to understand, providing a natural user experience.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The AI's knowledge is not generic. It is based on a secure knowledge base of verified documents from sources like the ICMR and WHO, which can be updated by administrators. This ensures all responses are safe, relevant, and context-aware.

Secure User & Admin Authentication:

Users log in securely via a one-time password (OTP) sent to their phone.

Admins (NGOs/health workers) have a separate, secure login to access a dedicated dashboard.

Admin Dashboard: A private web application where authorized personnel can upload new PDF documents (e.g., new scheme brochures, local health advisories) to instantly update the AI's knowledge base.

Automated Health Outreach:

Daily SMS Health Tips: Subscribed users receive a daily health tip via SMS, scheduled to run automatically.

Weekly Email Newsletter: A weekly email is sent out with a digest of health information and seasonal advice.

Persistent User Experience: The platform saves user profiles and chat history, allowing for a continuous and personalized experience across sessions. Language preferences are also saved per user.
